  <p>If we get to critical mass in any location, we'll pull together a first trial meetup and take it from there. There is also a <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/communities/114947921941709998407">Google+ community</a> which is used primarily to hold occasional hangouts (about once a month) that you can join from anywhere. </p>
